This program generates a random secret number between 1 and 100.
The user is asked to guess the number, and the program provides feedback:
- If the guess is too low: it says "Your number is too low."
- If the guess is too high: it says "Your number is too high."
- If the guess is correct: it congratulates the user and shows the number of attempts.

Key Features:
- Uses `random.randint(1, 100)` to select the secret number.
- Counts and reports the number of user attempts.
- Uses a `try-except` block to handle invalid (non-integer) input.
- Runs in a loop until the correct number is guessed.


import random

secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
print("Guess the number between 1 and 100.")
attempts = 0

while True:
    user_input = input("Type in your number: ")


    try:
        guess = int(user_input)
    except ValueError:
        print("Please, enter a valid number.")
        continue

    attempts += 1 

    if guess < secret_number:
        print('Your number is too low.')
    elif guess > secret_number:
        print("Your number is too high.")
    else:
        print(f"Congratulations! You found the number, which is {secret_number}.")
        print(f"Your attempts were {attempts}.")
        break
