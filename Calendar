"""
This program displays a full calendar for a given year using Python's built-in `calendar` module.

It uses `TextCalendar()` to generate a text-based calendar in a formatted layout.

Steps:
1. The user is prompted to enter a year.
2. The `formatyear()` method is used to create the full calendar for that year.
3. The result is printed in a readable layout.

Syntax:
    formatyear(year, w=2, l=1, c=6, m=3)

Where:
- `year` is the target year to display,
- `w` is the width of date columns (default is 2),
- `l` is the number of lines for each week (default is 1),
- `c` is the number of spaces between months (default is 6),
- `m` is the number of months per row (default is 3)

In this program:
    formatyear(year, 2, 1, 8, 3)
â†’ sets column width to 2, line spacing to 1, 8 spaces between months, and 3 months per row.
